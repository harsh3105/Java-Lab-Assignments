QUESTION 1:
Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in basic Java concepts. Eg., Write a program to read the First name and Last name of a person, his weight and height
using command line arguments. Calculate the BMI Index which is defined as the individual's body mass divided by the square of their height.

QUESTION 2:
Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in multidimensional arrays and looping constructs. Eg., If there are 4 batches in BTech(IT) learning ‘ITE2005’ course, read the count of the slow
learners (who have scored <25) in each batch. Tutors should be assigned in the ratio of 1:4 (For every 4 slow learners, there should be one tutor). Determine the number of tutors for each
batch. Create a 2-D jagged array with 4 rows to store the count of slow learners in the 4 batches. The number of columns in each row should be equal to the number of groups formed for that particular batch ( Eg., If there are 23 slow learners in a batch, then there should be 6
tutors and in the jagged array, the corresponding row should store 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,3). Use for-each loop to traverse the array and print the details. Also print the number of batches in which all tutors have exactly 4 students.
